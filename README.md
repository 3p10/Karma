# Karma
This is a web application done with react and express to implement a system that lets users improve the world (fight climate change, end wars and such). The system is built on the idea that users have a possibility to submit new posts (ideas) on how to improve the world. The other users have an option to comment and vote on the ideas. Comments and ideas can be edited afterwards if necessary.

The users are able to gather “karma” when other users vote up their ideas. Or if they vote down, then the karma is decreased.

# Install and Run the application:
- Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/3p10/Karma.
- install the node modules in both client and server sides by running 'npm i' in your terminal.
- First, run the server side using 'npm start'. It will run on localhost:3000. Then, run the client side using 'npm start' again. It will ask to open another port (localhost:3001). Type 'Y' and start running the program.
